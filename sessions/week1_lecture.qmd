# This week 

## Understanding and describing data 

- Quantitative research is the process of collecting and analysing **numerical data** to describe, model, and predict variables of interest.

- Garbage in, garbage out.

::: {.notes}
This lecture focuses on understanding and describing data. 

:::

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lecture you should:

1. Understand basic data types;
2. Consider how to summarise and represent data.


# Data types

## Four levels of measurements

|                          | Nominal | Ordinal | Interval | Ratio |
|--------------------------|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-----:|
| Categorizes and labels variables | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Ranks categories in order        |   | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Has known, equal intervals       |   |   | ✔ | ✔ |
| Has a true or meaningful zero    |   |   |   | ✔ |

- Developed by psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens (1906 - 1973)

## Nominal

- Differentiates items based only on names; no order between them.
- Also called **categorical data**
- Example: colour, gender, country names
- What can be said about them?
  - *Equality*: ‘apple’ is not ‘pear’, ‘apple’ is ‘apple’
  - *Mode*: the most common item

## Ordinal

- Allow for rank order, but not the relative degree of difference
- Example: measurement of opinions
  - *completely agree*
  - *mostly agree*
  - *neither degree nor disagree*
  - *mostly disagree*
  - *completely disagree*
- What can be said about them?
  - ✅ Equality; mode
  - ✅ Median: middle-ranked item
  - ❌ Differences between two levels; arithmetic mean

## Interval

- Allow for degree of difference between items, but not the ratio
- The *zero* value is arbitrary
- Example: Celsius temperature
  - Definition: define 0°C & 100°C, and then separate them into 100 intervals.
  - Depends on altitude/elevation 

- What can be said about them?
  - ✅ equality, mode, median
  - ✅ addition, arithmetic mean
  - ❌ ratio (*100°C is NOT twice 50°C*) 

## Interval

- Another example: longtitude & latitude coordinates
- *The coordinate of 8 is twice as far as that of 4*? ❌

## Ratio
- Allow for **ratio** between items
- The zero value is unique and non-arbitrary.
- Example: mass, length, energy
- What can be said about them?
  - ✅ Equality, mode, median, arithmetic mean
  - ✅ Ratio (*2kg is twice as heavy as 1kg*)

## Notes
- 'Encoding' does not change the nature of a measurement.
- Gender variable (male, female, others) is NOMINAL.
- If this variable is encodeded {male:0, female:1, others:2}, is it NOMINAL, or INTERVAL?

## Another categorisation: numerical vs. categorical
| Type                           | Category        | Notes                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Quantitative (numerical) data  | Discrete data   | Only in whole numbers, *e.g.* number of staffs |
|                                | Continuous data | *e.g.* temperature, 23°C, 23.4°C               |
| Qualitative (categorical) data | Nominal         | Same as nominal in 'Levels of measurement'     |
|                                | Ordinal         | See above                                      |


## Quiz time
::: {.notes}
Mentimeter quiz 

:::

# How do you descibe a ratio data? 

## Key metrics
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Quantity
- The middle
- The spread
:::

:::

::::

## US city population
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Quantity: 282 values
- The middle: Mean 302869.3
- The middle: Median 167744.5 (*Very different from mean*)
- The middle: Mode 106433 (Useful? ❌) 
- Should use mean or median? median is better than mean, as data is unlikely normal distributed
:::

:::

::::

## Variance: quantifying spread
Denote city population by $[y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]$ and variance by $\sigma^2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma^2 &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n} \\
&= \frac{(y_1 - \bar{y})^2 + (y_2 - \bar{y})^2 + \dots + (y_n - \bar{y})^2}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

A large variance means considerable spreadedness in data.

## Standard deviation $\sigma$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\text{Variance}}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Unit: if $y$ is in unit of meter (m), then St. Dev is in unit of m, variance in unit of $\text{m}^2$

## Summary of key metrics
:::: {.columns}

::: {.incremental}
- Quantity
- The middle: mean, median, mode
- The spread: variance, standard deviation
- *Visualising data is also important*: BOXPLOT!
- *Please check two types of SPECIAL VALUES before computing these metrics.*

# Visualising data

## FT visual vocabulary

![]({{< var module.web >}}/sessions/L1_images/FT_visual_vocabulary.jpg){style="max-width:90%; max-height:90%; margin:auto;"}

## Boxplot for a dataset
- Showing distribution of a dataset

![]({{< var module.web >}}/sessions/L1_images/Boxplot.jpg){style="width:70%; height:70%;"}

## Boxplot for comparing multiple datasets

## When boxplot fails?
- When there are lots of 'outliers' in the data
- What are 'Outliers'?

# Special values: null and outliers

## *Null* values
- Representing the absence of data or an unknow value
- Different from *zero* or *a blank space*
- Null values should be excluded before computing mean or std

## Null island in geography
- long=0, lat=0. Not even an island!
- It became famous because some software assigned "0,0" for long-lat when location is missing
- Many events were mapped to this one, including lots on Strava

## Outliers
- A data point that differs significantly from other observations
- There are three types of outliers
- Please explain the rationale for removing any identified outliers, including the criteria and methods used

## Outliers

| Type                           | Source                                                       | Handling                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Error Outliers**             | From mistakes in data collection/entry/measurement, e.g. a temperature sensor reading 500 °C | Should be corrected or removed                               |
| **Irregular Pattern Outliers** |  |  |
| **Influential Outliers**       |  |  |

## Outliers
| Type                           | Source                                                       | Handling                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Error Outliers**             |  |                                |
| **Irregular Pattern Outliers** | Genuinely occur, but do not follow general pattern or relationship in the dataset, e.g. sudden spikes in sales in Black Friday | They might indicate unusual events or anomalies worth investigating. If the purpose is to study overall pattern, they should be removed |
| **Influential Outliers**       |  |  |


## Outliers
| Type                           | Source                                                       | Handling                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Error Outliers**             |  |                                |
| **Irregular Pattern Outliers** |  |  |
| **Influential Outliers**       | Appear extreme but are integral to the underlying pattern or model, e.g. NYC in US city population data | Should keep them, as removing them could distort the analysis or overlook important features of the data |

## Detecting outlier: interquartile range (IQR)

## Quiz: which type of outliers?
- error vs. irregular pattern vs. influential

1. In building height data, 10-storey building with 1m height
1. In gender ratios of countries data, Vatican City with gender ratio of 7:1
1. In UK city GDP data, GDP of Greater London
