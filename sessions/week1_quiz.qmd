# Question 1

For a variable measured on an **ordinal** scale (e.g., survey responses from 'completely disagree' to 'completely agree'), which of the following metrics can be meaningfully calculated?

A.  Mean
B.  Median ✅
C.  Equality; mode ✅
D.  Standard Deviation

---

## Recap: Ordinal Data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
From the lecture, ordinal data allows for ranking, but the intervals between ranks are not necessarily equal.

- You can't say the difference between "mostly agree" and "completely agree" is the same as the difference between "mostly disagree" and "neither".
- Therefore, calculating a mean or standard deviation is not meaningful.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
> What can be said about them?
> - ✅ Equality; mode
> - ✅ Median: middle-ranked item
> - ❌ Differences between two levels; arithmetic mean

# Question 2

Which level of measurement is distinguished by having a true or meaningful zero, allowing for the calculation of ratios (e.g., "2kg is twice as heavy as 1kg")?

A.  Nominal
B.  Ordinal
C.  Interval
D.  Ratio ✅

---

## Recap: The True Zero

The key difference between **Interval** and **Ratio** scales is the nature of the zero point.

|                          | Interval | Ratio |
|--------------------------|:--------:|:-----:|
| Has known, equal intervals       | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Has a true or meaningful zero**    |   | ✔ |

-   **Interval**: Zero is arbitrary (e.g., 0°C does not mean 'no heat'). You cannot say 20°C is twice as hot as 10°C.
-   **Ratio**: Zero is non-arbitrary and means the absence of the quantity (e.g., 0kg means 'no mass'). This allows for ratio comparisons.

# Question 3

The mean of a variable can be calculated if the variable has a data type of:

A.  Nominal
B.  Ordinal
C.  Interval ✅
D.  Ratio ✅

---

## Recap: Calculating the Mean

To calculate a mean (or arithmetic average), the data must have known and equal intervals between values.

-   **Nominal** and **Ordinal** data do not meet this requirement.
-   **Interval** data is the first level where this is possible.
    > What can be said about them? ✅ addition, arithmetic mean
-   **Ratio** data also has this property.
    > What can be said about them? ✅ Equality, mode, median, arithmetic mean

# Question 4

Which of these metrics measure the variability (or spread) of an interval or ratio variable?

A.  Standard deviation ✅
B.  Range ✅
C.  Variance ✅
D.  Median

---

## Recap: Describing Data Spread

When describing a dataset, we look at three key aspects:

::: {.incremental}
-   Quantity
-   **The middle**: mean, median, mode
-   **The spread**: variance, standard deviation
:::

**Median** is a measure of the *middle* (central tendency), not the spread. **Range**, **variance**, and **standard deviation** all quantify how spread out the data points are.

# Question 5

In a dataset of city populations, which is typically highly skewed due to a few very large cities (like London or New York), you would generally expect:

A.  The mean population to be higher than the median population. ✅
B.  The median population to be higher than the mean population.
C.  The mean and median to be approximately equal.

---

## Recap: Mean vs Median in Skewed Data

This scenario describes a right-skewed distribution.

-   The **median** is the middle value and is resistant to outliers.
-   The **mean** is sensitive to extreme values (outliers). A few very large cities will pull the mean upwards.

As seen in the lecture's US City Population example:
-   **Mean:** 302,869.3
-   **Median:** 167,744.5 (*Very different from mean*)

> "median is better than mean, as data is unlikely normal distributed"

# Question 6

When calculating the mean of a dataset, how should *null* values be handled according to the lecture?

A.  They should be treated as zero.
B.  They should be replaced with the mode of the dataset.
C.  They should be excluded from the calculation. ✅
D.  They should be replaced with a blank space.

---

## Recap: Null Values

From the lecture:

> -   Representing the absence of data or an unknown value
> -   Different from *zero* or *a blank space*
> -   **Null values should be excluded before computing mean or std**

Treating nulls as zero would incorrectly lower the calculated mean and distort the result.

# Question 7

A building height dataset contains a 10-storey building with a recorded height of 1 metre. Based on the lecture's classification, what type of outlier is this most likely to be?

A.  Error Outlier ✅
B.  Irregular Pattern Outlier
C.  Influential Outlier
D.  A regular data point that should not be questioned.

---

## Recap: Types of Outliers

The lecture defines three types of outliers. This case fits the definition of an **Error Outlier**.

| Type             | Source                                                       | Handling                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Error Outliers** | From mistakes in data collection/entry/measurement, e.g. a temperature sensor reading 500 °C | Should be corrected or removed |

A height of 1 metre for a 10-storey building is physically impossible and is almost certainly a data entry or measurement mistake.

# Question 8

What does the 'box' part of a boxplot typically represent?

A.  The range from the minimum to the maximum value.
B.  The area containing 95% of the data points.
C.  The interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data. ✅
D.  The range covered by one standard deviation around the mean.

---

## Recap: Boxplots

The boxplot visualises the distribution of a dataset.

![]({{< var module.web >}}/sessions/L1_images/Boxplot.jpg){width="60%"}

- The **box** itself spans from the 1st quartile (Q1, the 25th percentile) to the 3rd quartile (Q3, the 75th percentile).
- The length of the box is the **Interquartile Range (IQR)**.
- It visually represents the central 50% of your data.
