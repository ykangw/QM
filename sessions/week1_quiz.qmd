# Let's Review the Quiz



## Question 1

For a variable measured on an **ordinal** scale (e.g., survey responses from 'completely disagree' to 'completely agree'), which of the following metrics can be meaningfully calculated?

A.  Mean
B.  Median ✅
C.  Equality; mode ✅
D.  Standard Deviation

###### Recap: Levels of Measurement

|                               | Nominal | Ordinal | Interval | Ratio |
| ----------------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :---: |
| Categorizes and labels        |    ✔    |    ✔    |    ✔     |   ✔   |
| Ranks categories in order     |         |    ✔    |    ✔     |   ✔   |
| Has known, equal intervals    |         |         |    ✔     |   ✔   |
| Has a true or meaningful zero |         |         |          |   ✔   |

**Explanation:** Ordinal data allows for ranking (**Median**) and counting frequency (**Mode**), but because the intervals are not equal, arithmetic operations like mean and standard deviation are not meaningful.

## Question 2

Which level of measurement is distinguished by having a true or meaningful zero, allowing for the calculation of ratios (e.g., "2kg is twice as heavy as 1kg")?

A.  Nominal
B.  Ordinal
C.  Interval
D.  Ratio ✅

###### Recap: Levels of Measurement

|                               | Nominal | Ordinal | Interval | Ratio |
| ----------------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :---: |
| Categorizes and labels        |    ✔    |    ✔    |    ✔     |   ✔   |
| Ranks categories in order     |         |    ✔    |    ✔     |   ✔   |
| Has known, equal intervals    |         |         |    ✔     |   ✔   |
| Has a true or meaningful zero |         |         |          |   ✔   |

**Explanation:** The true zero is the key feature of the **Ratio** scale. It signifies the complete absence of the measured quantity, which is what allows us to say "twice as much". An Interval scale (like Celsius) has an arbitrary zero.

## Question 3

The mean of a variable can be calculated if the variable has a data type of:

A.  Nominal
B.  Ordinal
C.  Interval ✅
D.  Ratio ✅

###### Recap: Levels of Measurement

|                               | Nominal | Ordinal | Interval | Ratio |
| ----------------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :---: |
| Categorizes and labels        |    ✔    |    ✔    |    ✔     |   ✔   |
| Ranks categories in order     |         |    ✔    |    ✔     |   ✔   |
| Has known, equal intervals    |         |         |    ✔     |   ✔   |
| Has a true or meaningful zero |         |         |          |   ✔   |



**Explanation:** To calculate a mean, we need to be able to add values and divide, which requires data to have **known, equal intervals**. This property begins at the **Interval** level of measurement.

## Question 4

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
Which of these metrics measure the variability (or spread) of an interval or ratio variable?

A.  Standard deviation ✅
B.  Range ✅
C.  Variance ✅
D.  Median
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .fragment}
#### Recap: Describing Data Spread

When describing a dataset, we look at:



-   Quantity
-   **The middle**: mean, **median**, mode
-   **The spread**: **variance**, **standard deviation**, **range**

**Median** is a measure of the *middle* (central tendency), not the spread. The others all quantify how spread out the data points are.

## Question 5

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
In a dataset of city populations, which is typically highly skewed, you would generally expect:

A.  The mean population to be higher than the median population. ✅
B.  The median population to be higher than the mean population.
C.  The mean and median to be approximately equal.
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .fragment}
#### Recap: Mean vs Median

-   The **mean** is sensitive to extreme values (outliers).
-   The **median** is resistant to outliers.

In a right-skewed distribution (like city populations), a few very large cities pull the mean upwards, while the median remains the "true" middle point.

From the lecture:
-   US City Mean: 302,869
-   US City Median: 167,744

## Question 6

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
When calculating the mean of a dataset, how should *null* values be handled according to the lecture?

A.  They should be treated as zero.
B.  They should be replaced with the mode.
C.  They should be excluded from the calculation. ✅
D.  They should be replaced with a blank space.
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .fragment}
#### Recap: Null Values

From the lecture:

> -   Representing the absence of data or an unknown value.
> -   Different from *zero* or *a blank space*.
> -   **Null values should be excluded before computing mean or std**.

Treating nulls as zero would incorrectly lower the calculated mean and distort the result.

## Question 7

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
A dataset contains a 10-storey building with a recorded height of 1 metre. What type of outlier is this most likely to be?

A.  Error Outlier ✅
B.  Irregular Pattern Outlier
C.  Influential Outlier
D.  A regular data point.
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .fragment}
#### Recap: Types of Outliers

| Type               | Source                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Error Outliers** | From mistakes in data collection, entry, or measurement. |

A height of 1 metre for a 10-storey building is physically impossible and is almost certainly a data entry or measurement mistake. According to the lecture, these should be corrected or removed.

## Question 8

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
What does the 'box' part of a boxplot typically represent?

A.  The range from the minimum to the maximum value.
B.  The area containing 95% of the data.
C.  The interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data. ✅
D.  The range covered by one standard deviation.
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .fragment}
#### Recap: Boxplots
The boxplot visualises the distribution of a dataset.

![]({{< var module.web >}}/sessions/L1_images/Boxplot.jpg){width="100%"}

The **box** itself spans from the 1st quartile (Q1) to the 3rd quartile (Q3), representing the central 50% of the data.
