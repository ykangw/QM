```

This week's practical is focussed on understanding regression analysis in an applied context. You will essentially re-create some of the analysis you saw in the lecture, but for slightly different variables and for different places.

You will notice that most of what you will be doing won't actually be regression analysis, but getting to know your data. This is how it should be!! Most of a good model

::: callout-note
Below you will find code-blocks that will allow you to run your analysis in either R or Python. It's up to you which you decide to use - you might even want to try both to compare (Of course, R will be better)!

The Juypter notebook attached to this practical *might* work, but you might be better off just firing up RStudio or VS code and running editing from scratch on your local machine.
:::

## Tasks

::: callout-warning
Make sure you complete each of the tasks below, 1-7. All of these will be covered in the code examples as you work your way down the page, but this is the full [workflow](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/workflow):
:::

### 1. Downloading: Download and read data into your software environment:

-   School locational and attribute information, downloaded from here - <https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Downloads> - or read it in using the code supplied below. This will include the following datasets:

-   **edubase_schools** = this is the 'all establishment' data for every school in England and Wales

-   School-level Key Stage 4 (14-16 GCSE level) attainment and other attribute information. [I have put this on Moodle here](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=8199904), but it can also be downloaded from here - <https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/download-data>.

    Download to a local drive on your computer from Moodle, unzip it and then read it in using the code supplied below. The zip folders contain the following data files in one folder and the associated metadata in the other folder:

    a.  **england_ks4final** = data on the 2022/23 academic year, school-level, KS4 outcomes and associated statistics

    b.  **england_abs** = data on the 2022/23 academic year, school-level absence rates

    c.  **england_census** = additional school-level pupil information for the 2022/23 academic year

    d.  **england_school_information** = additional school-level institution information such as Ofsted rating etc. for the 2022/23 academic year

    e.  **england_ks4_pupdest** = pupil destination data (where students go once they leave school at 16)

### 2. Data Munging: Join, filter, select and subset:

-   Create a master file for England called **england_school_2022_23.** This will be made by joining together all of the school-level data above into a single file and then reducing it in size using:
    a.  **filter** - so that it just contains open secondary schools
    b.  **select** - so that only a few key variables relating to attainment, progress, deprivation, absence and school quality remain, alongside key locational and other attributes.
-   Create two local authority data **subsets** from this main file:
    a.  A subset containing all of the secondary schools in one of the 32 London Boroughs (not including the City of London)
    b.  A subset containing all of the secondary schools in any other local authority in England. Any local authority you like - go wild!

At the end of this you will have **x3 datasets** - one national and two local authority subsets

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

-   Choose:
    a.  one attainment related dependent variable from your set
    b.  one possible explanatory variable which you think might help explain levels of attainment in schools
-   Create a series of graphs and statistical outputs to allow you to understand the structure and composition of your data. You should produce:
    a.  A histogram for the dependent and independent variables you are analysing for **both your two subsets** and the **national dataset** (x6 histograms in total). Also include:
        i.  mean and median lines
        ii. lines for the upper and lower quartiles
        iii. indications of outliners
        iv. a kernel density smoothing
    b.  Alternative plots such as violin plots or box plots to compare with the histogram
    c.  Point Maps of the locations of your schools in your two subsets - points sized by either of your variables
    d.  A scatter plot of your dependent (attainment) and independent (disadvantage) variables (national and two local subsets)
        i.  include a regression line of best fit
        ii. include the R-squared, slope and intercept parameters

### 4. Explanatory Data Analysis - Attainment and Factors Affecting it in Different Parts of England

-   Carry out a bi-variate regression analysis to explore the relationship between your chosen attainment dependent variable and your single explanatory independent variable, for your two subsets and the national dataset. **Questions to Answer**:
    a.  After visualising the relationships using scatter plots, do you think you need to transform your variables (e.g. using a log transformation) before putting into a regression model? Maybe plot scatter plots of your logged variables too!
    b.  What are the slope and intercept coefficients in each model? Are they statistically significant and how do vary between your two subsets? How do they compare with the national picture?
    c.  How do the R-squared values differ and how reliable do you think they are (what do the degrees of freedom tell you)?
    d.  What observations can you make about your two local authority study areas relative to the national picture?

## Task 1 - Download your data and read into your software environment

-   I've made this task easy for you by giving you the code to download all of this data. You'll need to download a selection of files - click on either tab to see the code for each.
-   In order to run this code, you should first [download and unzip the data from Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=8199904), before editing the code below so that you can read the data from a local folder on your computer:

::: callout-note
I would encourage you **NOT** to just copy and paste this code blindly, but try to understand what it is doing at each stage.

You may notice that there are some bits that are redundant (some of the NA code that I was messing with before deciding on a single way of removing NAs).

What am I doing to the URN field? Why might I be doing that?

What is the regex function doing and why might I be searching out those characters? What might happen to the data if I didn't handle those first?

## Task 2 - Data Munging

-   Use Python or R to join all of the datasets you loaded in the previous step into a single master file that we will called `england_school_2022_23` using the unique school reference number (URN) as the key.
-   Create the master file:

```{python}
# Left join england_ks4final with england_abs, census, and school information

    .merge(england_abs, on="URN", how="left")
    .merge(england_census, on="URN", how="left")

#### Iterative Checking and initial exploratory analysis

-   It's never too soon to start exploring your data - even (or indeed especially) in the data 'munging' (processing, cleaning etc.) stage.
-   You will probably find yourself iteratively plotting, filtering, plotting again, switching variables, plotting again, over and over again until you are happy with the data you have. This is all part of the Exploratory Data Analysis Process and vital before applying any other methods to your data!
-   If you recall from the lecture, the histogram of attainment 8 in the whole of England dataset looked a bit odd:

#### Further filtering and subsetting

-   Having joined all of these data frames into a single master dataframe for the whole of England and observed some issues, we will need to filter out some of the rows we don't want and the columns that we don't need
-   In the two folders you downloaded from Moodle, one contains all of the data we need, the other contains all of the metadata which tells us what the variables are
-   If you open up, for example `ks4_meta.xlsx` these are the variables related to attainment for each school.
-   Similarly `abbreviations.xlsx` attaches some meaning to some of the codes associated with some of these variables, with other metadata files containing other info. Take some time to look at these so you understand the range of variables we'll be exploring.

::: callout-note
One of the key filtering asks carried out in the code below is to filter the schools so that we only retain the maintained schools and the academies in the dataset
:::

## Task 2 (continued) - Filtering, Selecting and Subsetting

The Code Below already has the syntax to allow you to filter your dataset and drop special schools, independent schools and colleges.

It also contains the start of some code to allow you to select a smaller set of variables from the 700-odd in the main file.

1.  Adapt this Python or R code so that it contains these variables plus the additional variables listed below (see the note about how you may need to adjust the names depending on whether using Python or R). - You should end up with 34 in total
2.  Once you have created this filtered and reduced file called `england_filtered` use this code below as the template for creating two new data subsets:
    a.  london_borough_sub
    b.  england_lad_sub These two new files should create a subset which has filtered on the name or code of a London borough and another local authority in England

::: callout-note
If you are unsure of the names of the local authorities in England, use the `la_and_region_codes_meta.csv` file in your metadata folder to help you. You might want to name your "sub" files according to the names of the local authorities you choose.

::: callout-note
When you joined your datasets earlier, you will find that some variables appear in more than one of the datasets. This may cause a problem now as R and Python will try and distinguish them in the join by appending a `.x` or `.y` (R) or `_x` or `_y` (Python) so you may get an error when joining, particularly with the **SCHOOLTYPE** and **ADMPOL** variables. For these try **SCHOOLTYPE.x** and **ADMPOL.y** (underscore for Python) instead.
:::

## Task 3 - Further Exploratory Analysis and Visual Modelling

-   Using the example code below as a guide, select your own $Y$ variable related to attainment from your smaller filtered dataset. You have a range of attainment or progress related variables in there
-   Select your own $X$ variable that might help explain attainment, this might relate to disadvantage, prior attainment, absence or anything else that is a **continuous** variable (DO NOT SELECT A CATEGORICAL VARIABLE AT THIS TIME).
-   Once you have selected your two variables, plot them against each other on a scatter plot to see if there is an obvious relationship - again, use the code below as a guide.

AI - yes, that dreaded thing that's invading everything. Well, it's hear to stay and while it's here, you might as well use it to help you with your coding. Of course, I don't want you to blindly copy things and not understand what's going on, but if you get stuck with syntax and getting plots to look how you want - feed your favourite AI with your code and get it to help you out.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis - Distributions and slicing and dicing

-   You can also explore the scatter plot for your whole of England dataset.
-   One really interesting thing to do is to slice and dice your data according to some of the categorical variables.
-   In the R visualisation, you can see how we can start to slide and dice by regions, for example. Maybe try some of your other categorical variables.

::: callout-note
You will notice that in the plots below I have used a log10() transformation, but you could also use the natural log() or a range of other possible transformations. If you want to understand a bit more about transformations for normalisng your data, you should explore Tukey's Ladder of Powers - <https://onlinestatbook.com/2/transformations/tukey.html> - in R (and probably in Python too) there are packages to apply appropriate Tukey transformations so your data gets a little closer to a normal distribution.

#### Combining your outputs for comparison

Don't forget to run some basic regression modelling checks on all of your models:

        (1) Fixed incorrect annotation of the top most extreme residuals in
            the Residuals vs Fitted and, especially, the Normal Q-Q plots.
        (2) Changed Residuals vs Leverage plot to match closer the y-axis
            range shown in the equivalent plot in the R package ggfortify.
        (3) Added horizontal line at y=0 in Residuals vs Leverage plot to
            match the plots in R package ggfortify and base R.
        (4) Added option for placing a vertical guideline on the Residuals
            vs Leverage plot using the rule of thumb of h = 2p/n to denote
            high leverage (high_leverage_threshold=True).
        (5) Added two more ways to compute the Cook's Distance (D) threshold:
            * 'baseR': D > 1 and D > 0.5 (default)
            * 'convention': D > 4/n
            * 'dof': D > 4 / (n - k - 1)
        (6) Fixed class name to conform to Pascal casing convention

::: {.callout-tip title="Questions to Answer"}
Comparing your three regression models:

1\. How do the intercept (baseline) attainment values differ between your three models? **remember, if you (natural)logged your variables, you will need to take the exponential of the coefficient to interpret it back on the original scale.**

2\. What do the differences in the slope values tell you?

3\. Are your intercept and slope values statistically significant? If so, at what level?

4\. How do the R-squared values differ between your models?

5\. What can you say about your degrees of freedom and the reliability of your R-squared and other coefficients between your models?

6\. What is the overall story of the relationship between your attainment variable and your explanatory variable considering both your local examples and comparison with schools across the rest of England?
:::

### What does my model show?

1.  Baseline attainment (intercept) is much higher in Camden than in Leeds or the whole of England. Exp(6.12) = 455.32. So the Attainment 8 Score in Camden would be 455 (an impossible score) when % of disadvantaged children in a school are 0. This compares to exp(4.547) = 94.35 in Leeds and exp(4.478) = 88.06 in England as a whole. All of these intercepts are statistically significant (i.e. observed values not a chance relationship). While unrealistic (potentially due to the low degrees of freedom), the Camden intercept shows us that after controlling for disadvantage, baseline attainment in Camden is better than in Leeds or the rest of England. 

2.  The slope value of -0.207 for England shows that across the country. As this is a log-log model, it is an **Elasticity**: A 1% increase in % of disadvantaged students in a school is associated with a 0.21% decrease in attainment. HOWEVER, as this is a log-log model, the effect is far stronger at one end of the distribution than the other. 
    -   What this means is that a change from 1% to 10% of disadvantaged students in a school there is a 37.9% decrease in attainment, however, change from 21% to 30% leads to just a 7.1% decrease in attainment. 

::: {.callout-tip title="AI can help here!"}
One of the things that large language models are quite good at is interpreting regression coefficients in the context of real data. 

They don't always get it right, so **USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK WITH YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING**, however, they *can* help explain what YOUR model coefficients mean in relation to YOUR data in an incredibly helpful way. If you get stuck, try feeding an LLM (ChatGTP, Gemini etc.) with your regression outputs and a description of your data and see what it can tell you
:::

This effect is similar for Leeds, but apparently far more severe in Camden where the slope is much steeper. However, Camden doesn't experience very low levels of disadvantage in its schools (unlike in Leeds and the rest of the county), with the lowest level around 35%. With low numbers of schools in the Borough, this observation is potentially unreliable.

3.  The slopes and intercept coefficients in all models are all apparently statistically significant - but as we have seen with Camden, this does not necessarily mean our observations are generalisable! This is a good lesson in the difference between statistical significance (p-values are not a panacea!) and why you should always interrogate your model fully when interpreting outputs. 

4. Again, R-squared values might fool you into thinking the Camden model is 'better' than the other models, however, the R-squared is partially an artefact of the low degrees of freedom in the model. 

5. See above. 

6. Overall, we can make some crucial observations that encourage further research. While the model for England suggests a moderately strong log-log relationship between levels of disadvantage in a school and attainment, looking at this relationship for a London Borough (Camden) - and another Local Authority in England (Leeds) it's the case that this is unlikely to be a universal relationship. 

The baseline of attainment in Camden, controlling for disadvantage, is much higher than in the rest of the country. Students get higher levels of attainment, even when controlling for disadvantage. The log log relationship is crucial as it shows that on average, at low levels of disadvantage small increases have a more severe impact on attainment level, whereas at higher levels, similar changes have much reduced effects.
