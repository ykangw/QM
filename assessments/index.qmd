This Assessment is worth 100% of the grade for this course.

## Assessment Aims

This assessment is designed to test your understanding of the quantitative methods introduced in this course, but also, crucially, your ability to really understand how, if used correctly and applied to appropriate data, these methods can help you tell a powerful story and be the underpinning evidence-base for a relevant local, national or international issue.

Using quantitative methods to contribute to public debates is vital if students, academics and universities are to demonstrate our value to the wider world. We don’t want you to just apply a method and regurgitate unintelligible coefficients. Quantitative methods can only have real value if they are used to support wider debates in ways that everyone should be able to understand.

We are not testing your coding abilities – you may use either of the main coding languages taught this term (R or Python). We are not testing your ability to write a standard piece of academic writing. But we are testing your ability to use quantitative methods appropriately and with a clear connection between the data, methods and outputs, to help others understand a particular issue through a data lens.

### Part 1 - Article

Your task is to write a short 800-1000-word piece of ‘public-facing scholarly writing’ in the style of an article that that could appear in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/uk) or the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/ft-data) in their data section. This piece could relate to a local, national or international topic which could be either serious or frivolous but ***must*** employ appropriate quantitative methods learned in this course to derive novel insights from a particular dataset (or range of datasets) associated with a particular topic of your choosing. Data analysis and the use of quantitative methods should be central to your piece, but outputs must be appropriate for a general (non-academic) audience with your piece illuminated by appropriate visual outputs – maps, graphs or other data visualisations. Your piece should contain a range of graphical or tabular elements.

### Part 2 - Technical Appendix

Your 800-1000-word article should be accompanied by a max 1000-word technical appendix detailing the analysis you have carried out behind the scenes to allow you to make the observations you have in your article. Here you might want to include additional exploratory visualisations, tabular outputs, interpretations of those outputs, equations etc. and you could also include any observations about the dataset or the validity / statistical significance of any models you employ. The purpose of the appendix is to reassure anyone who wants to delve deeper, that the observations you made in your main article are valid and reliable and your interpretations valid.

### Topic

Your topic can be anything you like broadly related to human, urban or social issues, as long as you can find some suitable data to analyse. For inspiration on relevant topics, you might want to review some of the articles that John Burn-Murdoch has written for the Financial Times in recent years - <https://www.ft.com/john-burn-murdoch> (you can log-in via your UCL credentials) or some of the pieces in the Conversation - <https://theconversation.com/>.

If you are struggling for inspiration, you are welcome to explore an educational topic using DfE schools data used in class, but you are encouraged to be creative in your data choices (as you are being partially marked on your originality), and you should not repeat analyses carried out on variables in any of the practical sessions. The only topic we will ***not*** permit in this assessment is anything related to AirBnB as this is the focus of CASA0013.

### Article Content

You will note that most of John Burn-Murdoch’s articles generally contain the sorts of analyses we would describe as exploratory. While your article should contain basic exploratory analysis in the form of visualisations, you should ***also*** use an appropriate method from the second half of the course (lectures 5-10) related to ***either*** more sophisticated exploratory analysis like multivariate statistical analysis (e.g. dimensionality reduction ***or*** cluster analysis) *or* some explanatory / predictive methods such as ANOVA, linear regression or some of the generalised linear models also introduced.

### Style of Briefing

You should write in plain English and avoid the use of jargon or technical language. For tips on how to write in this style, The Conversation has produced a guide: <https://socsci.web.ox.ac.uk/files/conversation-writing-public-why-and-how>

### Types of Data Permissible and Sources

Anything you like, but you should choose carefully so that you are able to demonstrate the appropriate skills. There are many potential sources of data – these could be linked from FT or Conversation articles, or you could try sites like:

<https://data.gov/>

<https://www.data.gov.uk/>

<https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/>

<https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/>  

<https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets?locale=en>

<https://data.worldbank.org/>

<https://data.london.gov.uk/>

You can probably find many more!

### Referencing

We will not expect standard academic referencing in this piece, however, this doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t include references – you should. In this style of public facing scholarly writing, it is common to use hyperlinks and footnotes and you should make use of these to support your narrative.

### Format of the Piece

Examples – Here is just one example of the kind of article you might produce (minus the technical appendix), but read widely around the data journalism sites linked from publications like the Financial Times, New York Times, Guardian.

### Deadline and Handing In

The Deadline for the assessment is {{< var assess.deadline-date >}} \@ {{< var assess.deadline-time >}}.

Your report and technical appendix should be uploaded to Moodle as a single PDF document.

The purpose of this assessment is to test your understanding of the various methods introduced in this course and your ability to apply them appropriately to a topic of your choice. One of the differentiators at Masters level is the ability to think both creatively and critically while showing an awareness or knowledge of contemporary issues either in relation to your specific discipline of study or more widely. Being able to demonstrate how established techniques of research and enquiry can be used to create and interpret knowledge is at the core of Masters level thinking and this assessment piece. The ability to demonstrate self-direction (in choosing an appropriate topic for this assessment) and to think autonomously in designing your own article.

### Mark Scheme – Explained

Level 7 Descriptors - [https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/quality-code/the-frameworks-for-higher-education-qualifications-of-uk-degree-awarding-bodies-2024.pdf - p26](https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/quality-code/the-frameworks-for-higher-education-qualifications-of-uk-degree-awarding-bodies-2024.pdf%20-%20p26)

**Master's degree**

The descriptor provided for this level of the Frameworks is for any master's degree which should meet the descriptor in full. This qualification descriptor should also be used as a reference point for other qualifications at Level 7 on the FHEQ/SCQF Level 11 on the FQHEIS, including postgraduate certificates and postgraduate diplomas.

Master's degrees are awarded to students who have demonstrated:

•         a systematic understanding of knowledge, and a critical awareness of current problems and/or new insights, much of which is at, or informed by, the forefront of their academic discipline, field of study or area of professional practice

•         a comprehensive understanding of techniques applicable to their own research or advanced scholarship

•         originality in the application of knowledge, together with a practical understanding of how established techniques of research and enquiry are used to create and interpret knowledge in the discipline

•         conceptual understanding that enables the student:

•         to evaluate critically current research and advanced scholarship in the discipline

•         to evaluate methodologies and develop critiques of them and, where appropriate, to propose new hypotheses.

Typically, holders of the qualification will be able to:

•         deal with complex issues - both systematically and creatively, make sound judgements in the absence of complete data, and communicate their conclusions clearly to specialist and non-specialist audiences

•         demonstrate self-direction and originality in tackling and solving problems, and act autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a professional or equivalent level

•         continue to advance their knowledge and understanding, and to develop new skills to a high level. 

And holders will have:

•         the qualities and transferable skills necessary for employment requiring:  

•         the exercise of initiative and personal responsibility

•         decision-making in complex and unpredictable situations

•         the independent learning ability required for continuing professional development.
